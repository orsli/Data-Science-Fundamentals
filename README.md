#### Jupyter Notebooks edited and solved by
Urs Habegger, 21-114-236

Hi Guys, in this course, we learned to analyze data and datasets with Python and its different packages (i.e. pandas, NumPy, matplotlib) and thus use the mentioned notebooks to broaden our knowledge and get used to working with Python. The notebooks to the left are the ones that I edited and solved.

## Origin of the Juypter Notebooks
The edited Jupyter Notebooks were distributed by PD Dr. Sigve Haug through the [main repository](https://github.com/sigvehaug/DSF-DCBP) of this course.

## Learning Outcomes of this course
* using git repositories via web interface
* working with Jupyter notebooks on google colab
* implementing algorithms with Python
* performing data input, output, indexing, filtering and sorting with Python and Pandas
* performing descriptive statistics and visualization of data with Python
* performing numerical integration, ODE solving and fitting with Python
* manipulating text and performing automatized file management
* using HPC systems on Linux
* performing basic image processing with Python
* performing basic fitting and optimisation with Python
* performing basic inferential statistics with Python
