Hi Guys, the here visualized Jupyter notebooks were distributed by PD Dr. Sigve Haug from the University Bern. In this course, we learn to analyze data and datasets with Python and its different packages (i.e. pandas, NumPy, matplotlib) and thus use the mentioned notebooks to broaden our knowledge and get used to working with Python. The notebooks to the left are the ones that I edited and solved.
